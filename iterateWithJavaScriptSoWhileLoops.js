//Basic JavaScript: Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops
//Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so that the loop will push the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code finishes running.

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

do {

  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}

while (i <= 10);



console.log(myArray);
