//Basic JavaScript: Appending Variables to Strings

//Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.



// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "cool";
var myStr = "Learning to code is " 

myStr += someAdjective
