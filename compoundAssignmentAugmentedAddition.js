//Basic JavaScript: Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
//Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.

//note: there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line


a += 12; //a = a + 12;
b += 9; //b = 9 + b;
c += 7; //c = c + 7;
